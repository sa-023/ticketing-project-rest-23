/*
 * ü¶ã @Where(clause = "is_deleted=false")
 * ¬∑ Whatever repository is created from an entity that is annotated with @Where(clause = "is_deleted=false"), all the
 *   queries in that repository will automatically be concatenated with "is_deleted=false" as well.
 * ¬∑ The User entity class is annotated with @Where(clause = "is_deleted=false"), and UserRepository accepts User entity.
 *   Ex: How the query will run in the background: SELECT * FROM TableName WHERE is_deleted = false
 *                                                 SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_deleted = false;
 *                                                 SELECT user_name FROM users WHERE is_deleted = false;
 * ‚ùóÔ∏èUpdate
 * ¬∑ @Where(clause = "is_deleted=false") is adding an extra statement to our queries, and it might slow down the database,
 *   and it also does not include in our native queries. That's why we should avoid using this annotation and try a different way.
 *   Ex: User findByUserNameAndIsDeleted(String username, Boolean deleted);
 *       List<User> findAllByIsDeletedOrderByFirstNameDesc(Boolean deleted);
